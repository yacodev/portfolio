    `Iâ€™m a full-Stack Developer in love with technology who enjoys solving problems using software. I have two years of experience leading and working with teams to develop software for the construction sector, and in this period I founded my own startup (Construtec), it was a great experience.`,
    `Before I worked as a project manager in the construction sector, I worked for the Peruvian government building tracks, schools, and hospitals, but I always wanted to learn to develop software and try to solve problems using technology, so I started to study in Platzy and Codeable(Bootcamp), it was the best decision in my life.`,
    `I enjoy reading books about technology companies and everything related to entrepreneurship. I look forward to applying my leadership skills to help solve global problems in the technology industry`]
